# Meta-Learning for Fast and Privacy-Preserving Calibration of EEG-based BCIs  
Welcome! This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our "**Meta-Learning for Fast and Privacy-Preserving Source Knowledge Transfer of EEG-based BCIs**" paper at **IEEE** Computational Intelligence Magazine (**CIM**) - SI 2022.  
Codes will soon be polished and fully released :) Please check back at a later time.
